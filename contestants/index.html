                    Home to the infamous Arthur Wilson, and the final resting
                    place of over 300 souls, the Propitius terrorized not one,
                    but two generations of Americans, and is considered to be
                    one of the most infamous buildings still standing in the
                    country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Propitius hotel began construction in 1902. However,
                    there were reportedly many delays and alterations to the
                    plans throughout construction, leading it to not be
                    completed until late 1906. The reason for this was because
                    the project was headed up by Wilson himself. Without any
                    background in architecture, he insisted on providing all the
                    floor plan documents, which changed radically, sometimes
                    even multiple times in a single day. Even more curious, many
                    of the rooms were seemingly built without a given purpose,
                    and some seemed to be sealed up altogether after being
                    completed. It's also well documented that Arthur had secret
                    rooms and tunnels hidden throughout the building. Because of
                    the sheer volume of different floor plans, and Arthur's
                    penchant for secrecy, it's hard to find an accurate layout
                    of the building. Below are a few photos of a map that was
                    discovered in the 1980's, and as far as we know it's the
                    closest thing to an accurate layout of the Propitius.

                    The Propitius operated from 1906 to 1928, undergoing
                    constant renovations during the entire time it existed. It
                    was initially built as a place for gold miners to spend a
                    portion of their hard-earned wealth, however when the mine
                    dried up and prohibition hit, the hotel took on a new life
                    as a haven for drunkards, gamblers, and those in search of
                    vice. Wilson converted a number of spaces in the basement
                    into alcohol distilleries, and connected them to the
                    abandoned mining tunnels under the town for distribution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In November of 1928, one of the distilleries in the basement
                    exploded, uncovering the skeletal remains of over a dozen
                    bodies buried underneath. Wilson fled, and was never
                    apprehended. After the incident, the hotel was shut down,
                    and the rest of the town was quickly abandoned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Propitius, along with the rest of the town of Dire was
                    purchased by William Krentler in 1986 as a restoration
                    project. However, because of unsafe conditions, and out of
                    respect for the suspected number of bodies still on the
                    property, The Propitius was never opened to the public.

                                ore, and instead they created a snaking series
                                of tunnels that ended up sprawling just under
                                the town itself.

                <p>
                  Arthur was born in 1880 to John and Martha Wilson. John was
                  originally a doctor, however he was shunned from his hometown
                  of Sacramento when he was discovered to be doing grave
                  robbings for dissection projects and moved to Dire, a mining
                  town. While he had no knack for mining, he used his life
                  savings from practicing medicine to establish a mining
                  business in town that struck huge. He decided to inject his
                  new fortune back into the town, building a saloon and gambling
                  hall along with a clinic for him to run his practice. Arthur,
                  even from a young age, was taught from his father the
                  philosophy to set his sights high.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arthur did initially have an interest in medicine, reports say
                  he wanted to be remembered for an achievement greater than his
                  fathers, so he believed that by pushing forward the
                  understanding of what caused death, and how to heal it, he
                  could make some fantastic discovery that would change the
                  world. However, his ideas were often cruel, torturous, and
                  over time it seems he became much more fascinated in causes of
                  death, rather than how to prevent it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Combined with his fascination with medical experimentation on
                  both human and animal bodies, Arthur learned how to watch for
                  a moment of hopelessness in people and capitalize on it. In a
                  recovered journal entry from 1900 he wrote that he would wait
                  until his hotel patrons were completely penniless, then
                  convince them that he had found a vein of gold just outside of
                  town. Once in a mine, he would club them over the head and tie
                  them up, sometimes torturing them for days before killing
                  them.
                </p>
                <img

                  alt="Skulls on Old Table"
                />
                <p>
                  In 1902, when he was twenty two, Arthur pitched to his father
                  the idea of building a hotel the likes of which no one had
                  seen before. It would be a massive building that would become
                  the center of the town and become a draw in and of itself.
                  While John would retain ownership, he gave his son total
                  control of the project. Arthur got to work planning out a
                  multi-story hotel that not only had every modern convenience,
                  but also built a series of trapdoors and hidden rooms for him
                  to torture and kill people as his fixation on death and murder
                  grew. To counter the negative context of having a town called
                  Dire, he decided to name his establishment The Propitious, as
                  a monument to hope. On Novermber sixteenth, 1906, The
                  Propitius Hotel opened its doors to the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The hotel was an immediate success. It quickly expanded,
                  opening up an apothecary for tonics, and in the basement
                  Arthur built a larger medical center for his Father's medical
                  practice. While the gesture could have been one of kindness,
                  it's much more likely he used it as an opportunity to get
                  easier access to dead bodies to experiment on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1918, John Wilson disappeared. There is no evidence on
                  record regarding this, but it is assumed that Arthur killed
                  him. Upon his death, Arthur inherited the Propitius, along
                  with several businesses in town including a barber shop, a
                  mining provisions store, and a gambling hall. He shut them all
                  down and relocated the businesses to the Propitius. Arthur was
                  known to frequently check in with guests during shaves, or
                  when playing cards. At the time people believed him to be a
                  caring owner, making sure his guests were well served. In
                  hindsight it seems this was likely how he found targets. By
                  making his hotel the hub of the town he could easily learn who
                  was poor, alone, or getting ready to leave town. It would have
                  made for an excellent way to find victims without arousing
                  suspicion. Additionally, Arthur took on his fathers duties as
                  the town doctor, opening himself up to even more potential
                  victims.

                <p>
                  Once prohibition hit in 1919, he realized he had a great
                  opportunity to bring a whole new generation of victims into
                  the community. Because Arthur had so many underground tunnels,
                  he set up a distillery in one of the basements of the hotel
                  and became a booze-runner. Again he had an influx of desperate
                  drifters who would show up and work for him. No matter how bad
                  things got in the outside world, he always opportunities for
                  murder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1928, there was an explosion in one of his basement
                  distilleries, which led to the discovery of over a dozen
                  bodies. When authorities came to question Arthur, he was
                  nowhere to be found. There was an exhaustive search, but it
                  was concluded that he had somehow made a quick escape as soon
                  as the explosion happened. There is another theory that Wilson
                  was able to hide within the secret rooms and corridors of his

                <h3 class="display-5">1960-1965</h3>
                <p>
                  After four decades away from sight, Arthur Wilson returns to
                  the public eye in 1960 in a surprising way. A priest by the
                  name of Arthur Sutter had started appearing in newspapers
                  across the country, having formed a new Christian congregation
                  known as the Church of the Eighth Sin. While he was based out
                  of Chicago, Sutter traveled all over spreading his new
                  doctrine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to the budding civil rights movement, Sutter
                  preached about the sin of Defiance. He said that those who are
                  disobedient to their father are sinners. According to Sutter,
                  engaging in defiance against authority was akin to spitting in
                  God's face.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His following started small, but it grew substantially in
                  1964. Sutter called the ending of segregation an act of
                  defiance against the established rules in the government, and
                  was therefore a sin. He chastised flower children and
                  environmentalists, building a group of followers who were
                  strict and fervent believers in his extreme teachings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sutters movement was controversial, to say the least. After a
                  civil rights protestor died during one of his traveling
                  sermons in San Diego in January of 1965, Sutter revealed his
                  grand plan to his followers. He proposed that he, and 100 of
                  his most loyal followers would move to a remote location to
                  start a new colony of true believers.
                </p>
                <img
                  class="card-img border-3 border mb-3"

                  alt="Photo of Dire, rotting railroad station"
                />
                <p>
                  The followers, hand picked by Sutter, were not told where they
                  would be moving. Only to pack a suitcase of their clothes.
                  Most of these people would never be heard from again. Sutter
                  moved his congregation into the Propitious Hotel. He claimed
                  it was the perfect place for his congregation, because it was
                  a ghost town where they would only need to follow the word of
                  God, and his mouthpiece.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's largely unknown what actually took place inside the hotel
                  during this time. All recovered accounts come from a pair of
                  former members who claimed to have escaped the hotel. In their
                  story, Sutter had forced them into living like a cult-- he had
                  extreme control over their eating and sleeping habits, often
                  making them stay awake for upwards of 40 hours at a time. He
                  would separate them frequently from each other, and force them
                  to have one-on-one sessions with him. During these sessions,
                  there were reports that Sutter knew things that people had
                  only mentioned in private, which made him seem like he was
                  more than just a man.

                  Their Church services were extreme, parishioners were forced
                  to take LSD and other hallucinogens. While under the effects
                  of these drugs, Sutter would apparently claim he was Arthur
                  Wilson, and the devil gave him mind control powers that he
                  would use to force them to do bizarre and horrible things.

                  The anonymous survivors said they fled in the middle of the
                  night with a couple of bags filled with food and water, and
                  walked for nearly a week through the California desert before
                  they found a town. It was nearly another week before
                  authorities actually inspected The Propitius, finding 98 dead
                  bodies. They had all been gassed to death, and Arthur had shot
                  himself in the head

                <h2>Britt Holley</h2>
                Age: 27
                <p>
                  Years before the words Honey Boo Boo could be considered sane
                  when put together in a sentence, there was Britt Holley. And
                  for the last twenty years her name has rarely left our minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It all started back in 2006 when she was the breakout star of
                  Drama Mamas. The show was about a group of talented kids
                  trying to break into showbiz, while focusing primarily on the
                  immature antics of the kids' helicopter moms. Even though most
                  of the screen time was dedicated to the constant bickering and
                  backstabbing between fame-starved mothers, audiences couldn't
                  deny the magnetic and charming personality of 10 year old
                  Britt. Although featured cast members came and went with each
                  season, Britt was the only child to be a permanent cast member
                  for all five seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2013 she reappeared on our screens, now as an 18 year old
                  starring in her own series Welcome to Holleywood. This time
                  the attention was solely focused on her as audiences eagerly
                  awaited to see if her over-the-top personality could sustain
                  an entire series. Britt didn't just eat up the spotlight, she
                  devoured it as she and her wannabe actor friends redefined
                  what it meant to be a reality star.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From this point on the names of her shows changed based on
                  whatever her current endeavor was, but she remained at the
                  center of the reality-verse. From 2016-2019 Britt starred in
                  Holleywooed. During that time she got engaged, married, then
                  divorced to Gage Preston, the only other castmate from her
                  previous series that found any sort of fame on their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2020 she restarted her career with a new show, new network,
                  and new cast. Britt traded her bourgeois friends and
                  ex-husband for her family, moving them all over from Texas to
                  LA in her most recent series, The Beverly Holley's. Also, for
                  the first time, Britt signed a contract for her new series to
                  air on the Krentler Media Channel, instead of TLC. The show
                  had just finished airing its second season when Britt
                  announced she would be taking part in Slashtag.

                    D-wreck is an online personality, known for making viral
                    prank videos, and streaming video gaming content on Twitch.
                    While his real name is Derek Sarecki, he's been almost
                    universally known as D-wreck since he rose to popularity in
                    the early 2000's.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    He attributes his fame largely to an incident he shared on
                    the late night talk show Jimmy. He referred to himself as
                    “the ultimate latch-key kid” with a lot of free time after
                    school and a whole house to himself.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    “I had a roll of quarters, a stick, and a bag full of dog
                    poop I'd found on the sidewalk. I don't remember what the
                    original plan was, I stole my parents video camera from
                    their bedroom. When I went to check the tape on the camera--
                    to make sure I wasn't recording over something important
                    like me opening an Xbox at christmas-- I found what turned
                    out to be my parents homemade sex tape. I think most kids
                    would see something like that and be scarred for life, and
                    don't get me wrong, I think it's definitely a contributing
                    factor to creating the monster I am today. What I ended up
                    doing was re-cutting the tape so that my dads grunts sounded
                    exactly like the beat to We Will Rock You and played it at
                    school while I sang along.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    D-wreck joked that it was a while before he got access to a
                    video camera again, but by that point there was no going
                    back. He had already had a taste of the attention gained
                    from sharing content that is equal parts distasteful and
                    humorous, and by the time he was sixteen he was one of the
                    biggest names on youtube.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    By the age of 20, he started streaming himself playing games
                    online, which would frequently turn into pranks or skits
                    that often left audiences wondering if what they had just
                    seen was real or fake.

                    His unique brand of performance art has also landed him in
                    trouble a handful of times. The first of which was during
                    the height of the “Swatting” craze, when video gamers would
                    call in fake threats to the police against their online
                    competitors. D-wreck faked a swatting prank in which he
                    faked his own death on camera, which caused fierce backlash
                    by both the public and Law Enforcement. As penance, D-wreck
                    submitted himself to undergo 30 days of prison time. The
                    video blogs that followed only served to increase his
                    popularity in the long run, which only led to him staging
                    increasingly outlandish (and illegal) stunts.

                  <p>
                    The culmination of these stunts has primed D-wreck to be the
                    ultimate wildcard for Slashtag!

                    Though her given name is Koyuki Suura, to the world she's
                    known as Kawaii Kiki. Born to Japanese immigrant parents In
                    Sydney Australia, Kiki grew up in a household that was very
                    different from the lifestyle she leads today. Little is
                    known of her childhood, aside from that she briefly had a
                    sister, who passed just before her first birthday, and that
                    her parents worked in the field of medical technology, and
                    pushed her hard to go into medicine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the biography page on her website, she was
                    planning to go to the University of Sydney until one fateful
                    trip to the US the summer after her senior year of high
                    school. She hadn't seriously considered following her
                    passion until her cosplay of Kerrigan from Starcraft II(with
                    real functioning wings) won the grand prize at the 2016 San
                    Diego Comic-Con Masquerade. She was offered a spot as a
                    contestant on the brand new Syfy reality competition series
                    America's Next Top Cosplayer, which would film during her
                    first semester of college.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a difficult decision to make, Kiki put college
                    indefinitely on hold to compete, and ultimately win the
                    show. From there her life became a whirlwind of paid
                    appearances at conventions, which led to sponsored cosplays
                    from video game and film producers from around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, Kawaii Kiki makes as much money with her cosplays as
                    a top-tier fashion designer, and is known around the world
                    for her amazing artistry. She's participated and won Cosplay
                    contests at conventions around the world except for
                    Australia. According to her, she's already spent more than
                    enough time there and has no intentions of returning any
                    time soon.

                <h2>Landon Keating</h2>
                Age: 42
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Landon Keating is a TV, film, and rock star, and son of
                    Hollywood legend Great Scott Keating. Aside from a few
                    cereal commercials as a kid, Landon didn’t begin acting
                    until he starred as the voice of Gary Reptillicus III in the
                    1988 saturday morning cartoon, King of the Creepies. The
                    show ran 8 seasons, during which time Landon began making
                    live-action appearances on popular family sitcoms like
                    Packed House, Piece by Piece, Family Affairs, and Kid Meets
                    Planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the time Creepies wrapped, he was starring in high school
                    comedies and testing the waters of drama. In 1997 he played
                    a small role in the Oscar nominated film North Dakota, which
                    gave him his first taste of serious drama.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the late 90’s Keating was a known presence around Los
                    Angeles’ notorious Viper Room, where he met the other
                    members of what would become his band Copycat. Most of the
                    2000’s were spent with his band, though the majority of his
                    publicity came from his frequent appearances on TMZ for his
                    very public drug-fuelled freak outs. Though his band did
                    have some success, making their way onto the billboard top
                    10 multiple times over their three album run, they never
                    quite hit the level of stardom that Landon had experienced
                    in acting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2011, Keating reappeared after vanishing from the public
                    eye for several years, sober and hungry for a comeback. He
                    landed the lead role of Martin Shkreli in the biopic Wu Tang
                    For One, in which he received an Oscar nomination for best
                    actor. Even though he lost the award, his career seemed to
                    be on track for a huge comeback. His return to the King of
                    the Creepies franchise only gained him more attention as he
                    returned for the live action film in 2013.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then in 2014 Murder Manion happened. Not only was the film a
                    critical and commercial flop, his bizarre over-the-top
                    performance as serial killer Arthur Wilson was heavily
                    lambasted over the internet. It seemed overnight that Landon
                    had turned from one of Hollywood's most promising comeback
                    stories to its biggest joke.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet somehow, despite having seemingly lost the respect of
                    the majority of his fans, he only continued to land bigger
                    roles in even larger box-office disasters. His followup
                    feature, a superhero movie called The Manimal, successfully
                    killed the budding Deadbolt Comics superhero franchise
                    before it ever got off the ground. Most recently, he was
                    almost comically miscast as Woody in the recent live-action
                    adaptation of Toy Story.

                <h2>Chef Costanza</h2>

                Age: Unknown
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Chef Costanza is an online cooking personality and
                    professional chef. Reporting on his biography is a
                    challenge, due to his extremely mysterious nature. Despite
                    being one of the most popular celebrity chefs out there, no
                    one knows who Chef Costanza actually is. Years before The
                    Masked Cheerleader made its way onto our screens, Costanza
                    was wearing his signature rubber mask in all of his cooking
                    tutorials on Youtube.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His channel quickly rose to fame, not just because of the
                    gimmick, but because his dishes were inventive, elevated,
                    and simple enough for a home cook to follow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Costanza's rise to fame was not overnight, though he did
                    seem to make the jump from Youtube talent to guest judge on
                    Top Chef fairly quickly. Costanza has remained tight-lipped
                    on how he rose to stardom so quickly, though the internet
                    seems to be divided by two theories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One group firmly believes Costanza to already be a notably
                    famous TV chef who wanted to experiment with anonymity and
                    gimmicks. If true, he's been wildly successful at it, since
                    every name has been thrown out from Guy Fieri to Paula Deen
                    with a voice modulator. Even seeing Costanza on the same
                    screen as other chefs hasn't been able to dissuade some
                    fans, insisting that editing techniques have been used to
                    throw fans off his scent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other operating theory (and the one that personally
                    seems more likely), is that Costanza is just a
                    well-connected chef who has earned a lot of respect in the
                    cooking industry and decided to wear the mask in order to
                    avoid too much attention in his personal life. Many people
                    believe this is the case especially after he explained on
                    Graham Norton why he chose to don the mask. “At first the
                    entire goal was just to focus on the food. I didn't want the
                    audience to get distracted by who was cooking it, his
                    pedigree or background or whatever. It was about the food.
                    Of course that plan backfired massively, and now I'm sitting
                    here instead of making duck confit recipes in my New York
                    apartment.”

                Age: 24
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Shawn Eamon is a former professional athlete. He played on
                    the New Orleans Saints from 2019-2021.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Originally from a small town near Guntersville Alabama,
                    Shawn's had football in his blood from an early age. He was
                    the only freshman in his class to play for the varsity team.
                    According to Eamon, he attributes most of his early success
                    with a natural growth spurt he had during adolescence.
                    During his senior year, his team went nearly undefeated,
                    earning him a football scholarship to the University of
                    Alabama.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While moving up to the college level definitely put him in a
                    bigger pond, he still remained a relatively big fish. He was
                    a middle linebacker, using his size and speed to make for an
                    almost impossible defense to break through. While his team
                    did not make the playoffs, he was recruited personally from
                    the team to join the NFL on the New Orleans Saints. His
                    position was demoted to outside linebacker, but he was
                    finally in the big leagues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, his career was rather short lived. After the
                    Saints won the superbowl in 2021 for the second time in
                    history, the teams quarterback and MVP Danny Roth outed
                    himself and Shawn as gay partners during the postgame
                    interviews.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The revelation was shocking to many fans, and caused an
                    uproar in the NFL community. While there have been several
                    gay players in the league, this was the first time two
                    players on the same team were actively in a relationship.
                    During the draft for the next season, Danny Roth was
                    recruited as a first pick for the San Francisco 49er's,
                    while Shawn was overlooked entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the time since, Shawn's more or less dropped off the map.
                    He appeared on several news segments on CNN and KMC, and did
                    a couple commercial spots, but aside from that he seems to
                    be living the quiet life back in his hometown in Alabama.

                    Tawny Howlett is an online personality, makeup entrepreneur,
                    and lifestyle guru. She is best known for her makeup
                    tutorial videos, which she started producing in 2007 when
                    she was only 17 years old.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    She quickly became one of the most followed makeup
                    personalities on Youtube, and in 2011 she launched her first
                    signature makeup line through Maybe-Line. It was a huge
                    success, spawning several more lines for Maybe-Line until
                    her products grew into athletic accessories, healing
                    crystals, healthy-eating guides and more.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In 2015, she broke off from Maybe-Line when it was exposed
                    that they tested many of their cosmetics on animals. Tany
                    instead formed her own company, and manufactured all of her
                    products ethically. This gained the attention of multiple
                    wildlife protection associations like Peta, The Humane
                    Society, and Save the Giraffes. Since then Tawny has become
                    a champion for the protection of animals.

                    In late 2022 Tawny announced that she and D-wreck were in a
                    relationship in an announcement that shocked just about
                    everyone. At first people thought it was one of D-wrecks
                    signature pranks, however the couple have been spotted
                    canoodling around LA for nearly six months now, so it would
                    seem their relationship is legit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Even more shocking, in the week leading up to the premiere
                    of Slashtag, Tawny has come under fire for producing a
                    fitness drink that has left dozens of consumers with
                    horrific food poisoning. It seems the mask is slipping from
                    the internets golden girl, and I for one can't wait to see
                    how she fares inside of Slashtag.
